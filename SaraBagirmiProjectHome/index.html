<h1>The Sara Bagirmi Languages Project</h1>
  <h3>John M. Keegan</h3>
  <h3>bongobagirmiorg<br class="breakup">@gmail.com</h3>

  <h2>Project Scope</h2>
  <p>This project is dedicated to the study of the Sara-Bagirmi languages, a group of the Central Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan languages. They are spoken principally in Chad and northern Central African Republic. A outline of current information about the languages' geographical location, distribution, numbers of speakers, and classification can be found with SIL's Ethnologue. It is often difficult to find all the sources for these languages, and one is constantly coming across unpublished works -- student theses, missionary works, etc -- for which it is difficult to find a published reference.</p>
  <p>All languages will be additionally identified by their Ethnologue tag, indicated by square brackets. For example, the Bagirmi language is tagged as [bmi].</p>

  <h2>Sources</h2>
<p>Sources for the language data for specific languages is noted with that language. Most of the information regarding number of speakers and their geographic location has been taken from Lewis (2009),which we will refer to here as the Ethnologue. Another important source of data is the College Charles Lwanga in Sarh, which we refer to as CCL.</p>

<p>At present, the <a href="http://www.morkegbooks.com/Services/World/Languages/SaraBagirmi/pdfs/SaraBagirmiBibliography.pdf" target="_blank">project bibliography</a> is preliminary. We have hopes to be able to revise this in the near future. At some point we would also like to a brief summary of the works contained in the bibliography.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
<li>Gathering existing language data for each of these languages (lexicons, grammatical notes, texts, conversation books, etc.) into the project database.</li>
<li>Working with a control list, collect from native speakers a minimum of 700 words for each language, each with a sample sentence.</li>
<li>Record words and sentences with a native speaker, and add the recordings to the language database.</li>
<li>If possible, use a single system of transcription and a single font for all of the languages. A description of the
writing system used for the Sara Languages is contained in <a href="http://www.morkegbooks.com/Services/World/Languages/SaraBagirmi/pdfs/Transcription.pdf" target="_blank">
Transcription for Sara Languages</a>. The transcription for the Sara Kaba and Bagirmi languages will be similar, although there will be some letters (e.g. nasalized vowels) that are not required. Several new letters will also be needed (e.g. the palatal implosive in Kulfa and Bagirmi and  the palatal nasal in Bagirmi and Sara Kaba languages)..</li>
<li>As work progresses, create lexicons (in pdf format) and allow web researchers access to them from this site.
</li>
<li>Edit and print low-cost lexicons for distribution to language groups in Chad. Further, collections of lexicons
will be into volumes that also include an introduction to the language, as well as an introduction to the subgroup
and the language family. (We have currently completed 3 of these volumes:
<i>The Central Sara Languages,</i>
<i>The Eastern Sara Languages,</i> and
<i>The Western Sara Languages</i>).
</li><li>Maintain and publish a comparative listing of all the project languages, with access from both French and
English. (The first version of this is now complete for the Sara Languages.)
</li>

<li>Gather a digital version of the language data, including sound files, so that it can be distributed on
DVD's with software that allows a dictionary view of the language in which users can click on words and
sentences to hear them spoken by native speakers.
</li>
<li>To create this web site which we hope to move at some point to a university server from which all of the
language data will be stored, thereby providing long-term security for the data and access to it
for any interested parties. The website will all include all published works as .pdf files.
</li>
<li>Once the website is created, create a web application that permits simple searching of the data for any language based on the French or English word.  The word, meanings, sample sentences and expressions will then be returned to the user, together with the sound files, so that the information is accessible from the internet.
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Language vs. dialects:</strong> linguists at times appear to be in a rush to make a determination as to whether
a given speech form is a full-fledged languages or a mere dialect of another language or dialect group. If
one were to use the most common 1,000 words as criteria for such decisions, then we would be forced to conclude
that all Sara Languages are a dialect group of one language. However, when we undertake a comparison of larger
dictionaries, such as the dictionary of Sar and that of Mbay, we find that less than 50% of the words are cognates.
While progress is being made in this area, there are still relatively few languags for which we have more than
1,500 distinct entries. A second problem is the fact that over the past twenty years there has been an important
trend of language merging. In major cities, for example, more precise vocabulary is being dropped in favor of
simpler forms recognized by speakers of other languages or dialects. A major goal of this project is to create larger lexicons and dictionaries of these languages, so that speakers have the resources to relearn lost aspects of their language.  The approach taken in this project is to consider all speech forms a language until
we have sufficient data to prove otherwise.
</li>
<li><strong>Writing System vs. Transcription:</strong> the system of transcription used in the project is not intended to be a proposal for a writing system.
Rather, it is intended to capture all phonogical distinctions found in each language using a single symbol for each phoneme, with the tone clearly marked.

</li>
<li><strong>Translation language:</strong> the web pages and most of the introductions to the language lexicons have been
written in English. The lexicons, with the exception of Mbay, have French translations for the Sara-Bagirmi words and sentences. With the Mbay dictionary, the translations are in English.</li>

  <h2>
Central Sara as a Subgroup of the Sara Languages</h2>

<p>  	There are a fair number of characteristics which appear to justify the separation of Bebote, Bejondo,
  	Gor, Gulay and Mango as a subgroup of Sara. A few differences are listed below:</p>


  <ol>
  <li>Phonological Characteristics
  <ol>
  <li>common use of the vowel pattern <b>/o...e/</b>.</li>
  <li>use of <b>'p'</b> (e.g. <b>pòr</b>  'fire') where <b>'h'</b> is found in Eastern Sara. </li>
  <li>maintenance of final <b>'r'</b> where it becomes <b>'d'</b> in Western Sara.</li>
  <li>Voiceless stops in intervocalic position do not become voiced as they do in
  Western Sara.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Morphologial Characteristics</li>
  <ol>
  <li>use of the a verb subject plural affix not found in Eastern Sara.</li>
  <li>use of a noun formation prefix not found in Eastern Sara.</li>
  <li>use of a third person singular oblique marker not found in Eastern Sara.</li>
  <li>use of the a noun plural marker not found in Western Sara (Mango excepted).</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Lexical Characteristics
  <ol>
  <li>use of the word <b>njà</b>  'foot', different from the word in Western Sara.</li>
  <li>use of unique form for the conditional 'if' that is not found in Eastern or Western Sara.</li>
  <li>the number 10 is different from the forms used in Eastern Sara.</li>
  <li>all use the same preposition of ownership, a form not found in Eastern Sara.</li>
  <li>use of a unique form for the conjuction 'and, but' (with the exception of Gulay).</li>
  </ol></li>
  </ol>
  The grouping is by no means perfect.  First, for the most part it is of a negative nature: the Central Sara
  languages group on the basis of a characteristic that they do not share with Eastern or Western languages, but not both. Second, Gulay has many lexical characteristics common in Eastern Sara languages,
  while Mango has some morphological characteristics common of Western Sara languages. More details on this
  question are found in <i>The Central Sara Languages</i> volume.
<br><br>
<h4>Bebote</h4>
<p>Bebote is a small Central Sara language spoken in an area around the town of Beboto, to the south of Doba and a short distance to the west of the Gor capital, Bodo. In the Ethnologue Bebote is considered a dialect of Bejondo.</p>

<h4>Bejondo</h4>
<p>Bejondo ([bjv]) is referred to in Ethnologue as Bejond. It is spoken in the Mandoul Occidental Department in an area around the town of Bediondo, southeast of Doba and north of the Gor capital, Bodo. According to Caprile and Fedry (1969), there were 36,000 speakers at that time.</p>

<h4>Gor</h4>
<p>Gor ([gqr]) is spoken in a small area south of Bedjiondo in the Doba prefecture, centered around the town of Bodo. Lewis (2009) estimates the number of speakers at 87,000.</p>

<h4>Gulay</h4>
<p>Gulay ([gvl]) is spoken in the Dobo, Mahim-Toki, Murum-Guley, Ngangara and Peni cantons in the Mandoul Oriental department of the Moyen-Chari, in the Murum-Guley and Kututu cantons in the department of Pende of the Logone Orientale, and in the Dono-Manga canton in the Tandjile-Est department. According to the 2009 census, there are 250,000 Gulay speakers in these three departments. This number includes some 25,000 Pen, who do not consider themselves Gulay.</p>

<h4>Mango</h4>

<p>Mango ([mge]), also called Mongo, Mbay Doba and Doba, is the language spoken in a wide area around the city of Doba, as well as in a few isolated villages along the Central African border. There were said to be approximately 52,000 speakers of Mango in 2006.</p>

<h3>The Central Sara Languages Volume</h3>
<p>	The Central Sara Languages (6th edition, 495 pages), provides lexicons for four Central Sara Languages/dialects: Bebote, Gor, Gulay and Mango. Currently, the lexicon for Bejondo is not included.</p>
<p>Each lexicon contains between 1,150 and 1,650 words, most with samples sentences illustrating the word's use. The words and sentences have been translated into French so as to be of greater use to readers in Chad. Several hundred idioms, most with sample sentences, have also been added for Mango and Gulay.</p>
<p>Introductory notes in English are provided for each language, describing key features of the phonology and morphology. Also included is a more general introduction to the Sara Languages, together with a description of the transcription used in describing them. There is also a discussion of the distinctive characteristics of Central Sara which might justify its its separation as a subgroup of Sara.</p>

<h2>Eastern Sara as a Subgroup of the Sara Languages</h2>

<p>	There are a fair number of characteristics which appear to justify the separation of Daba, Mbay, Nar, Ngam,
	and Sar into a subgroup of Sara. A few differences are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phonological Characteristics
<ol>
<li>unlike Central and Western languages, all the Eastern Sara languages except for Daba
maintain a phonological distinction on the basis of vowel length.</li>
<li>in the Eastern Sara languages, <b>'h'</b> is moderately common in initial position
(e.g. <b>hòr</b>  'fire').  In
the Cental and Western languages, these words normally appear with <b>'p'</b>. </li>
<li>maintenance of final <b>'r'</b> where it becomes <b>'d'</b> in Western Sara.</li>
<li>Voiceless stops in intervocalic position do not become voiced as they do in
Western Sara.</li>
<li>unlike Central and Western Sara languages, schwa is not a phoneme.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Morphologial Characteristics</li>
<ol>
<li>Only in Eastern Sara languages (Sar, Nar and Ngam) is -n (low tone) used as the 3rd person singular oblique pronominal suffix where reference to the subject is not required.
</li>
<li>use of a noun formation prefix not found in Central or Western Sara.</li>
<li>use of the a noun plural marker not found in Western Sara.</li>
<li>the Eastern Sara languages do not use the affix <b>-i</b> (in mid tone)
to indicate that the subject of a very. Instead, <b>-n</b> (in mid tone) is normally used.</li>
</ol>
<li>Lexical Characteristics
<ol>
<li>use of the word <b>gé</b>  'to want', a form not found in  Western Sara.</li>
<li>all Eastern Sara languages use the same word for 'thing', a form not used in Western Sara.</li>
<li>use of the word <b>njà</b> 'foot', a form not found in  Western Sara.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
The grouping is by no means perfect.  First, for the most part it is of a negative nature: the Central Sara
languages group on the basis of a characteristic that they do not share with Eastern or Western languages, but not both. Second, Gulay has many lexical characteristics common in Eastern Sara languages,
while Mango has some morphological characteristics common of Western Sara languages. A more detailed
justification of this division is found in <i>The Central Sara Languages</i> volume.
<br><br>
<h4>Daba</h4>
<p>Daba ([dgk]), referred in The Ethnologue as Dagba, is said to be spoken by 40,000 speakers, principally in the Batangafo, Kabo, and Bossangoa subprefectures in northern Central African Republic, but also with a few villages on the west bank of the Bar Sarh river in the Moissala Subprefecture of Chad.</p>

<h4>Mbay</h4>

<p>Mbay ([myb]) is spoken by some 80,000 speakers in Chad a wide area around Moissala in the Mandul prefecture, south of Koumra. Mbay extends across the border with the Central African Republic, where another 8,300 speakers are found.</p>

<h4>Nar</h4>
<p>Nar is considered by the Ethnologue to be a dialect of Sar with some 32,000 speakers. It is spoken in the area around Beboro, between Koumra and Sar.</p>

<h4>Ngam</h4>
<p>
Ngam ([nmc]) is spoken in a wide area around Maro, south of Sarh, and spreading south across the border with the Central African Republic. According to the 1993 census, there were some 43,000 speakers in Chad and another 18,000 in Central Africa. The Ethnologue also reports that speakers of the extinct language Horo now speak a dialect of Ngam.</p>

<h4>Sar</h4>
<p>According to the Ethnologue, Sar ([bjv]) is spoken by approximately 151,000 speakers (subtracting the 32,000 speakers of Nar). It is spoken in a wide area around Sarh, Bedaya and Koumra in the Moyen-Chari and Mandul prefectures in southern Chad.
</p>
<h3>The Eastern Sara Languages Volume</h3>
<p>	The Eastern Sara Languages (5th edition, 443 pages), provides lexicons for four Eastern Sara Languages/dialects: Daba, Nar, Ngam and Sar. Currently, a lexicon for Mbay is not included.</p>
<p>Each lexicon contains between 900 and 1,450 words, most with samples sentences illustrating the word's use. The words and sentences have been translated into French so as to be of greater use to readers in Chad. Several hundred idioms, most with sample sentences, have also been added for Sar and Nar.</p>
<p>Introductory notes in English are provided for each language, describing key features of the phonology and morphology. Also included is a more general introduction to the Sara Languages, together with a description of the transcription used in describing them. There is also a discussion of the distinctive characteristics of Eastern Sara which might justify its its separation as a subgroup of Sara.</p>

<h2>Western Sara as a Subgroup of the Sara Languages</h2>

<p>	There are a fair number of characteristics which appear to justify the separation of Kaba, Laka
	and Ngambay into a western subgroup of Sara. A few differences are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phonological Characteristics
<br>
<ol>
<li>when <b>'d'</b> is immediately followed by a word-final barred-i in Central and Eastern languages,
it appears as <b>'r'</b> in the western Sara Languages.</li>
<li>when <b>'h'</b> appears in the Eastern Sara languages, <b>'p'</b> appears in Western Sara
(e.g. <b>pòr</b>   'fire').  </li>
<li>When voiceless stops appear in intervocalic position in Eastern and Central Sara languages,
they are voiced in Western Sara.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Morphologial Characteristics</li>
<ol>
<li>Only the Western Sara languages use with <b>je</b> (mid-tone) with the oblique
pronominal markers to indicate respect.
</li>
<li>The Western Sara languages employ the prefix <b>n-</b> (in high tone) to indicate 'he, she' before verbs.
In Eastern Sara and most Central Sara languages, 'he, she' is indicated by the lack of an prefix.
</li>
<li>The Western Sara languages mark the plural of nouns <b>je</b> (in mid tone). Eastern Sara languages
and most Central Sara languages use a different plural marker.
</li>
<li>Only in the Western Sara languages Laka and Ngambay is no distinction made between 'our' and 'your (plural)'.
</li>
</ol>
<li>Lexical Characteristics
<ol>
<li>The word in Western Sara for 'foot' is distinct than that used in Eastern and Central Sara
languages.</li>
<li>The word in Western Sara for 'six' is distinct than that used in Eastern and Central Sara
languages.</li>
<li>The Western Sara word for 'stomach' is different from the word used in Eastern Sara.</li>
<li>The Western Sara word for 'many, much; very' is distinct from the word used in Eastern
Sara and most Centra Sara languages.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
The grouping is by no means perfect.  First, for the most part it is of a negative nature: the Central Sara
languages group on the basis of a characteristic that they do not share with Eastern or Western languages, but not both. Second, Gulay has many lexical characteristics common in Eastern Sara languages,
while Mango has some morphological characteristics common of Western Sara languages. A more detailed
justification of this division is found in <i>The Central Sara Languages</i> volume.
<br><br>
<h4>Kaba</h4>
<p>
Kaba ([ksp]) is called "Kabba" in numerous works, as in some dialects the 'b' is implosive. According to the Ethnologue, there are 72,000 speakers in the Paoua and Marounda subprefectures of northern Central African Republic, and 11,000 speakers in Chad in the area around Gore, to the south of Moundou.</p>

<h4>Laga</h4>
<p>According to the Ethnologue,Laga ([lap]) is spoken by approximately 55,000 people. The Laga are found in southern Chad, principally in the Bessao, Monts de Lam and Oudoumia cantons to the south of Moundou. In addition, there are some 2,000 speakers in northern Central African Republic in the Bocaranga Subprefecture. L'Association de Recherche et d'etudes de la Langue Laga claims that there are also many thousands of speakers living in Cameroon.</p>

<h4>Murum</h4>
<p>
The Ethnologue considers Murum a dialect of Ngambay. Negor and Mekongoto (1978) consider Murum a distinct language, spoken the Gabri Ngolo, Dormo and Murum-tulum cantons which lie north of the city Doba and west of the Gulay speaking cantons.</p>

<h4>Ngambay</h4>
<p>Ngambay ([sba]), with around a million speakers, is by far the largest Sara language, and it probably has the largest number of native speakers of any language in Chad. It is spoken in a wide area around the city of Moundou in southern Chad and throughout the Sara neighborhoods of N'djamena.</p>

<h3>The Western Sara Languages Volume</h3>
<p>The Western Sara Languages (2nd edition, 457 pages), provides lexicons for three Western Sara Languages/dialects: Kaba, Laka and Ngambay. Currently, information for Murum is not included.</p>
<p>The lexicon for Kaba contains approximately 1025 words, the lexicon for Laka has 1875 words, and the lexicon for Ngambay has over 3,000 words and over 900 idioms. Samples sentences are included for most words. The words and sentences have been translated into French so as to be of greater use to readers in Chad.</p>
<p>Introductory notes in English are provided for each language, describing key features of the phonology and morphology. Also included is a more general introduction to the Sara Languages, together with a description of the transcription used in describing them. There is also a discussion of the distinctive characteristics of Western Sara which might justify its its separation as a subgroup of Sara.</p>

<h1>The Sara Kaba languages</h1>
<p>  The Sara Kaba languages are spoken in an area in Southern Chad generally east of the area where the Sara languages are spoken. They include five languages: Kaba Na, Kaba Deme, Kulfa, Sara Dunjo, and Sara Kaba.</p>
<p class="indent">In the classification of the Sara Kaba group used in the Ethnologue, it is considered a Sara Proper Language. This gives the erroneous impression that these languages are as closely related to other Sara Proper languages, say Gulay or Sar, as Gulay and Sar are to each other. While Sara Proper Languages and Sara Kaba Languages are clearly related, there are important phonological, morphological, lexical and syntactic differences. A speaker of a Sara language in N'Djamena will be able to understand much of what a speaker of any other Sara Proper dialect is saying. But he or she will be unable to understand sentences in a Sara Kaba languages such as Na. A preliminary comparison of differences between Sara Kaba and Sara Proper languages is found in at Sara Kaba <a href="https://morkegbooks.com/Services/World/Languages/SaraBagirmi//pdfs/NotesOnSaraKabaClassification.pdf" target="_blank">Is Not Sara Proper.pdf</a></p>

According to the Ethnologue, there are some 40,000 speakers in Chad, and unknown number in the Central African Republic.</p>
<h4>Kulfa</h4>
<p>According to the Ethnologue, there were some 7,300 speakers of Kulfa and closely related dialects in 1993, living in the Southeast part of the Moyen Chari Prefecture in the Kyabe Subprefecture, southwest of Lake Iro and centered in Alako and Kirimikoro.</p>

<h4>Na</h4>
<p>Na, also called Kaba Na or Sara Kaba Na, is spoken in the Moyen-Chari region, Lac Iro Department, centered in Kyabe, and in Central African Republic. The Ethnologue estimates that there were 35,000 speakers in Chad in 1993.</p>

    <p>Gulay est une langue parlée au sud du Tchad dans la préfecture de Dono Manga, au Nord-est de Doba. Sélon Keegan (2012) Gulay est plus apparantée aux langues Saras Centrales (Gor, Bedjondo, et Mango) qu'aux langues Saras de l'Est (Sar, Mbay, Ngam, etc.). Selon  Lewis (2009), il y avait environ 163.000 locuteurs de Gulay en 1993. Gulay appartient au groupe Sara, de la famille nilo-saharienne (groupe soudanais central et sous-groupe bongo-baguirmienne).
Ce lexique contient à peu près 1650 mots, 1850 phrases illustratives et 240 expressions idiomatiques. L'information sur Gulay a été recueillie à N'Djaména au cours des étés 2010, 2011, et 2012, en travaillaint surtout avec Ngaradoumbay Clement. On a aussi travaillé une session longue avec Nadjirisengar Moise. Le lexique doit être consideré un point de départ pour un dictionnaire authentique de cette langue intéressante. Nous avons l'espoir de pouvoir effectuer un petit dictionnaire avec plus de 3000 mots avant la fin de 2013.</p>
